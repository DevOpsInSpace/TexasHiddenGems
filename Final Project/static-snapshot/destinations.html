                <img src="media/images/proctorsprings.jpg" class="images">
                    <p>
                        Originally designated as a historical landmark in 1971, Proctor Springs offers a quiet and inviting getaway. Hiding just inside Cameron Park's main entrance, this little known getaway spot boasts fresh rolling spring water, multiple trails, disc golf activities, and a covered pavilion for barbques and gatherings.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        If you're looking to explore Proctor Springs for the first time, be sure to check out the surrounding area, as there are many hiking trails near by, plenty of great fishing spots closely located at the Brazos river, and one of the best disc golf courses in Texas.

                <a id="tonkawafalls.html"><h3>Tonkawa Falls</h3></a>
                <img src="media/images/tonkawafalls.jpg" class="images">
                    <p>
                        If you ever find yourself traveling through Central Texas, it's worth checking out our next gem. Tonkawa Falls is located in a sleepy town called Crawford. Home to President George W. Bush, Crawford can easily be missed on the map along with Tonkawa.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Thus, we thought this would make an excellent find for those seeking gems. Nestled just off the highway lies one of Texas' best kept secrets. Tonkawa falls offers fresh spring water rolling down a miniature waterfall, aproximately one story high. While you may find some eager kids looking to jump off the nearby cliffs, we suggest taking a relaxing dip into the sacred waters below. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tonkawa's rich heritage eminates from the Tonkawa Native Americans that traveled through the land long ago. Fast forward through time and we can thank the Texas Civil Works Administration for funding the construction of Tonkawa Park. Tonkawa Park offers RV recreation, and easy access to the incredible Tonkawa Falls.

                        <a id="horseshoebay.html"><h3>Horseshoe Bay</h3></a>
                <img src="media/images/horseshoebay.jpg" class="images">
                    <p>
                        While this next location is technically referred to as Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, it's located in Horseshoe Bay; a wonderful city of moguls located deep in the heart of Texas Hill Country. With an average home value of almost one million dollars, Horseshoe Bay is no stranger to wealth. Along with these high standards, comes an even higher standard of rest and relaxation.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Whether you're looking to go for a swim in the lake, get in some great fishing action, golf, or jet skiing, Horseshoe Bay has it all. When you're tired of water recreation, there are plenty of nearby activities, trails, and scenery. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of Horseshoe Bay's best kept secrets (Yes, I know you've been waiting for it!) is the Horseshoe Bay Resort. Complete with golf, spas, restaurants, a marina, tennis, fitness, and even a private airport, you're sure to be amazed, entertained, and well taken care of. 
                    <p>

                <a id="krausesprings.html"><h3>Krause Springs</h3></a>
                <img src="media/images/krausesprings.jpg" class="images">
                    <p>
                        This next hidden gem definitely tops the list for me. Krause Springs. Have you heard of it? No? Well now you have! Prepare yourself for the ultimate camping getaway. Nestled outside the small town of Spicewood, Texas lies this whimsical, magical, and unforgettable destination. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        You'll find yourself at a cattle guard after a long and winding treck through the Hill Country. Mosey a bit further and you'll be greeted by a chipper man and woman with the likes of Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus. With a few dollars to spare, you can claim your own plot for the night, weekend, or an even longer stay! Did I mention they allow RVs, tents, and even pitching a sleeping hammock?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The best part of it all? Well, there's mutliples of those. Take your pick of swimming in the man made natural spring fed in ground pool with a custom rock diving ledge, a pond down below fed by the same spring with a blissful waterfall to medidate under, or enjoy the afternoon away in a larger than life hammock tucked deep within their flourshing garden complete with giant windchimes. Does it sound like your cup of tea, too?
                    <p>
                <br>
                        <a id="crystalbeach.html"><h3>Crystal Beach</h3></a>
                    <img src="media/images/crystalbeach.jpg" class="images">

                    <p>
                        You didn't think our list could be complete without an actual beach, did you? Surely not! While most people think of Galveston or Corpus Christi when the idea of a great Texas beach comes up, we're here to tell you about the best kept <em>secret</em> beach. Crystal Beach.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Nesstled just off the coast of Texas, well, as a penesula actually, lies Crystal Beach. The best part about this? Tourists need to take a ferry to the location unless they're willing to drive two hours out of their way. Lucky for you, you're an adventurer, and you'd consider the ferry "part of the journey"; thus, you'll get there in just an hour's time. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Crystal Beach is a favorite of the locals for multiple reasons, they allow campfires on the beach, have a great night life "scene" on their small town strip, and most days are perfect for sunbathing, swimming, fishing, and water recreation.
                    </p>
